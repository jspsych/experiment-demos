# Attention Network Task-Flanker Task 
[Description](http://lcni-3.uoregon.edu/phenowiki/index.php/Attention_Network_Task-Flanker_Task_(ANT))

[In depth description](https://scienceofbehaviorchange.org/measures/attentional-network-task/)

This task tests the three attentional networks of alerting, orienting, and executive control. It is a combination of a cued reaction time task and a flanker task.

The flanker task stimuli are presented at the top or bottom of the screen. An alerting star(s) is also presented in the following locations:
- upper
- lower
- both
- center
- none

## Conditions
- cue type (5)
    - upper
    - lower
    - both
    - center
    - none
    
- target location (2)
    - upper
    - lower
    
- target direction (2)
    - left
    - right
    
- flanker condition (3)
    - congruent
      - flanking arrows the same direction as the target direction
    - incongruent
        - flanking arrows the opposite direction as the target direction
    - neutral
        - the target is flanked by lines without arrowheads
    
There are a total of 60 unique condition combinations. 
The resulatant measures need to be accuracy and response time for the following conditions:
- cue type (5)
- target location (2) 
- flanker condition (3)
This is 30 different measures!!!
  
# To do
- Add instructions
- Add practice trials
- Should there be trials with feedback?
