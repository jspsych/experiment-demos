Jason's goals and notes


Can I get a site where a user clicks items from a list and presses "administer."

These tests are then run and the user takes the tests.

GENRAL NOTES
If each questionnaire gets setup in a JS file, there also needs to be an accompanying HTML file to load and run the JS file. There only needs to be one edit to change an HTML file from one questionaire to another.
